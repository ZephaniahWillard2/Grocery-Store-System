    b) Sections for various functions: 
        - an inventory list showcasing all items, 
        - a <form> to add new inventory items, 
        - and a notification area under the inventory list for if certain items are low in stock (3 items or fewer).
          The section for adding new inventory items should have input fields for the item name, quantity, price, and categories. 
          Categories should be selectable through radio buttons offering predefined options (e.g., fruit, dairy).
